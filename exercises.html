       <h1>EXERCISE AS A NATURAL MOOD BOOSTER</h1>
       <p class=intro-text>How physical activity releases endorphins and reduces stress.</p>
       
       <p>Exercise is widely recognized for its natural mood-boosting effects, largely due to its influence
on brain chemistry. Physical activity stimulates the release of endorphins, often referred to as
"feel-good" hormones. Endorphins are neurotransmitters that reduce pain perception and can
create a sense of well-being, sometimes described as a "runner’s high" in those who engage in
sustained aerobic activity like running or cycling. This surge of endorphins can alleviate
symptoms of stress, anxiety, and even mild depression, providing a natural boost in mood and
emotional resilience.</p>
       
       <p>Additionally, exercise helps reduce levels of stress hormones, like cortisol. By lowering cortisol,
physical activity alleviates tension and creates a relaxation effect post-workout. This
combination of higher endorphin levels and reduced cortisol makes exercise a powerful tool in
managing stress and improving mental health. Physical activities that focus on mindful
movement—such as yoga, tai chi, or even walking—additionally activate the parasympathetic
nervous system, often called the "rest and digest" system, further promoting a sense of calm.</p>
       
       <p>Research supports the effectiveness of regular exercise as a mental health aid. For instance, a
study in JAMA Psychiatry found that individuals who regularly exercise have a lower risk of
developing depression compared to those who are less active review in Frontiers in Psychology
confirms that physical activity can significantly reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and
general stress levels.</p>
