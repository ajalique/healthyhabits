    <h1>MEAL PLANNING FOR BEGINNERS</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">Steps to plan nutritious meals that align with fitness goals.</p>
           
    <p>Nutrition is essential for supporting fitness, providing the energy and nutrients needed to fuel workouts and maintain a balanced lifestyle. Here’s how eating right can enhance your exercise performance and recovery:</p>
    
    <h2>1. Start strong with a balanced breakfast</h2>
    <p>A good breakfast sets the tone for the day, replenishing blood sugar levels and supplying energy for both mental and physical tasks. Regularly eating breakfast is linked to lower risks of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. If you're working out in the morning, skipping breakfast can leave you feeling weak or lightheaded. For lasting energy, choose fiber- and protein-rich options over simple carbs—try whole-grain cereals with milk, or whole-grain toast with eggs or nut butter.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Get the right carbohydrates</h2>
    <p>Carbs fuel your body, especially during exercise, but quality matters. Instead of simple carbs like sweets, opt for complex carbohydrates found in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Whole grains digest more slowly, helping you feel full longer and keeping blood sugar stable, which can boost your energy throughout the day.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Pack in protein</h2>
    <p>Protein is key for muscle repair and growth, especially important if you’re exercising regularly. While protein isn’t the main energy source during workouts, it supports your muscles’ recovery and maintenance. Choose lean protein sources such as chicken, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, and nuts. Adults generally need about 0.36 grams of protein per pound of body weight, with increased needs for those who exercise intensely.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Load up on fruits and vegetables</h2>
    <p>Rich in fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants, fruits and vegetables are essential for overall health and workout performance. Aim to fill half your plate with colorful fruits and veggies at every meal to cover a broad spectrum of nutrients. Dried fruit and fresh vegetables make great snack options on the go.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Incorporate healthy fats</h2>
    <p>Healthy fats, like those in nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil, help reduce inflammation and supply essential fatty acids. While the body stores enough fat for long-term energy, incorporating healthy fats in moderation can support cellular health and overall well-being.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Pre-workout snacks for energy</h2>
    <p>A small snack before working out, ideally combining carbs and protein, can provide a quick energy boost. Examples include a banana with peanut butter, yogurt with berries, or a handful of nuts and dried fruit. These snacks offer vitamins, minerals, and natural sugars to power your workout.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Maintain a healthy calorie intake</h2>
    <p>While cutting calories can aid weight loss, reducing them too drastically can lead to fatigue and health issues. For safe weight loss, women should aim for 1,200–1,500 calories per day, and men, 1,500–1,800 calories. Active individuals or those not aiming to lose weight may need more calories to sustain energy and health. Consulting a dietitian can help tailor your calorie intake to your specific goals.</p>
    
    <h2>8. Balance is key</h2>
    <p>As you settle into a fitness routine, pay attention to how different foods affect your energy and performance. Opt for balanced meals that include complex carbs, lean proteins, healthy fats, and a variety of fruits and veggies.</p>

    <p class=intro-text>The right nutrition fuels exercise, helping you perform at your best, recover quickly, and stay energized.</p>
           
    <h1 class=section-spacing>UNDERSTANDING MACRONUTRIENTS</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">The role of proteins, carbs, and fats in a balanced diet.</p>
    
    <h2>What are Macronutrients?</h2>
    <p>Macronutrients are the nutrients we need in larger quantities that provide us with energy. Macronutrients are the nutrients we need in larger quantities to provide energy. The energy from macronutrients comes from the grams of food consumed: protein, carbohydrates, fats. Micronutrients are mostly vitamins and minerals, and are equally important but consumed in very small amounts.</p>
           
    <h2>Why They Matter:</h2>
    <p>They provide energy, repair tissues, and support bodily functions.</p>

    <h2>PROTEINS</h2>
    <p><strong>Role in the body:</strong></p>     
    <ul>
        <li>Muscle repair and growth.</li>
        <li>Hormone and enzyme production.</li>
    </ul>
           
    <p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lean meats</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Beans</li>
        <li>Tofu</li>
        <li>Dairy</li>
    </ul>
           
    <p><strong>Recommended intake:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>How much protein the average adult needs daily.</li>
    </ul>
           
    <h2>CARBOHYDRATES</h2>
    <p><strong>Role in the body:</strong></p>     
    <ul>
        <li>Primary energy source.</li>
        <li>Essential for brain function and physical activity.</li>
    </ul>
           
    <p><strong>Types of Carbohydrates:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Simple Carbs (e.g., sugars)</li>
        <li>Complex Carbs (e.g., whole grains, vegetables)</li>
    </ul>
           
    <p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Whole Grains</li>
        <li>Fruits</li>
        <li>Vegetables</li>
    </ul>
           
    <h2>FATS</h2>
    <p><strong>Role in the body:</strong></p>     
    <ul>
        <li>Provides energy.</li>
        <li>Supports cell growth.</li>
        <li>Protects organs.</li>
    </ul>
           
    <p><strong>Types of Fats:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Saturated Fats</li>
        <li>Unsaturated Fats</li>
        <li>Trans Fats</li>
    </ul>
           
    <p><strong>Healthy Fats:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Emphasizing unsaturated fats from sources like avocados, nuts, and olive oil.</li>
    </ul>
           
    <h2>How to Balance Macronutrients?</h2>
    <p><strong>Example of a Balanced Meal:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Visual of a plate with 50% vegetables, 25% protein, and 25% carbs.</li>
    </ul>
           
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Include variety in each meal.</li>
    </ul>
           
    <p class="intro-text">In conclusion, Macronutrients are essential for the body's functions, and it’s important to know which foods provide the right amounts. Some people believe that reducing one macronutrient and increasing another is key to weight loss, but these trends are not recommended for a healthy lifestyle. Tracking macronutrient intake can lead to misuse if not managed properly. For instance, a bag of baked chips may contain 120 calories, which might fit into a daily calorie limit, but it won’t satisfy hunger long-term, leading to overeating. Healthier options, like apples and nuts, are more filling and beneficial in the long run.</p>
           
           <h1 class="section-spacing">CALORIE TRACKING 101</h1>
<p class="intro-text">How to track daily calorie intake and its impact on health.</p>

<p>Calorie tracking helps manage weight by balancing calories consumed with those burned, aiding in weight loss, maintenance, or gain. It promotes mindful eating, helping individuals avoid empty calories and focus on nutrient-rich foods. Tracking also reduces the risk of health issues like obesity and diabetes, supports steady energy levels, and provides a structured approach to dietary habits, enhancing both physical and mental well-being.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>
<p>Understanding calorie intake helps manage weight and maintain energy balance.</p>

<p><strong>How Calories Work:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Calorie = Unit of energy.</li>
        <li>Calories in vs. calories out (expenditure).</li>
    </ul>
           
<p><strong>Impact on Health:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Too many or too few calories can impact weight and energy levels.</li>
        <li>Aim for color and nutrient diversity.</li>
    </ul>
